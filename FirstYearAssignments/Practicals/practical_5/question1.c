(a) int params[3][3];

an integer array that has 2 dimensions and uses 3*3*16 bits for memory

(b) char	matrix[A][B];

an array called matrix that has AxB(2 dimensions)and uses AxBx8 bits for memory

(c) double space[50][50][10];

a double precision floating point array that has 3 dimensions that uses 50*50*10*64 bits or memory

(d) int p[2][4]={{1,3,5,7},{2,4,6,8}};
