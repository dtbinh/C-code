Allied Irish Bank's Executive Chairman has said that the bank got things badly wrong and that dealing with this legacy will take time.

Speaking at the publication of the bank's results, David Hodgkinson said the bank lent too much to the property sector.

AIB announced earlier that it expects to cut 2,000 jobs during 2011 and 2012.

The job cuts will be spread across the organisation and the bank insists the vast majority of lay-offs will be voluntary.

Massive job cuts had been expected at AIB as the bank is now just over 92% owned by the State, has to restructure, sell assets and raise cash to get back to profitability.

A new 'core' bank is to be established.

The bank announced total losses of just over €10bn for last year.

Mr Hodgkinson said he understood the hurt, anger and frustration felt by investors who between them had lost €18bn over the last three years.
