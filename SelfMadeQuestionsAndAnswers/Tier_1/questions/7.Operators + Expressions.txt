1. Evaluate the expression (x*y+4)
   is it the same as (((x)*(y))+4) all the time
   Comment on why and how it can differ if these
   expressions are declared at the top of the program

	#define x 5*7+2-8
	#define y 10*2-8+1

2. using the compund statements below comment 
   on what they do and also how they differ from the 
   normal statements
   show by example

	a++
	++a
	a--
	--a
	a+=b
	a-=b
	
3. using the other compund operators , like the above
   comment on what they do and also how they differ
   from normal statements

	a*=b
 	a/=b
	a&=b
	a%=b
	a^=b
	a|=b
	a<<=b
	a>>=b
	
4. Using the more advanced conditional operator
   the ternary operator
	create a scenario where the conditions
	from the expression are evaulated 
	randomly
	Example z= (a<b)? b :c;

5. Create a function to take a integer from the user
   and print the binary equivalent

6. Evaluate the below expression

	if(abs(x)< xmin){ x = (x>0)?xmin:-xmin;}

7. Implement and comment on the equations
   
	x1=( ((-B)+(sqrt((B*B)-(4*A*C)))/(2*A) );

    	x2=( ((-B)-(sqrt((B*B)-(4*A*C)))/(2*A) );

   use them for these values a=2,b=4,c=2	

	
8. Evaluate the below equation and comment on what it does

	double function(double number)
	{
		double something=10;
		double variable_1=1,variable_2=0;
		int count;
	
	
		for(count=0;count<10;count++)
		{
			variable_2 = (.5) * ( variable_1 + ( number / variable_1) );
			variable_1 = variable_2;
		}
		return variable_1;
	
	}

9. Evaluate the below function and comment on what it does

	double coulomb(double Q1,double Q2,double d)
{
	double answer;
	double left,right;
	left=( 1/((4*22/7)*(pow(8.854,-12))) );
	right= (Q1*Q2)/(d*d);
	
	return answer=( right * left );
}

10. Using the operators , write a program that will take a year from the user
    The program will then say whether the year is a leap year or not
