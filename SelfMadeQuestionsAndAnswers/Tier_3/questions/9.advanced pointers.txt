1. write a program that will have a pointer to a function called add 
   have it such that when the user enters 2 numbers it will pass the 2
   numbers into the function pointer to add and add will return the result

2. modify the  program so that it will have pointers to functions called
   add that will have 2 arguements and addv which has a variable number of arguements
   caution : variable arguements with function pointers have to be done with pointers

3. using an array of pointers to functions ,  create a menu that will call a function
   by using the functions pointers
   basic things to use for the functions is print hello world , clear screen 
   maybe pascals triangle and exit the program
