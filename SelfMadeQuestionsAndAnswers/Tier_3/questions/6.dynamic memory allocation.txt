1. using memory allocation , create a space for an int using malloc

2. using memory allocation , allocate a space for a char using malloc

3. using dynamic memory allocation , create an array of integers of size int using malloc

4. using memory allocation , allocate a space for a string of characters 
   12 places in size using malloc

5. modify the above so that the memory is allocated using calloc()

6. modify the above so that the space is re-allocated using realloc()

7. using the above program , after the string has been printed de-allocate the memory
   check to make sure the memory was freed and have safety guards to make sure the 
   memory is de-allocated

8. create a struct called student with these variables

   A. char* name
   B. int Student_Number
   
   now within your program , allocate a block of memory for that struct

9. create an array of structures using the above struct and allocate 
   4 instances of the struct

10. modify the above so that if there will be more than 4 , the 
    program will reallocate more memory for the new struct
