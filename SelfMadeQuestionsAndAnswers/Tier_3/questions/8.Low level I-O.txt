1. create a program that will create and write to a BINARY file
   call the file binary_number_file.dat
   have it take N integers and cancel on the input of a letter

2. create a file that will read the above file and convert during runtime 
   the binary into integers and print them out 
   Make sure to have the relevant checks to make sure the file exists
   can be read and the feof is found

3. create a program that will write a string to a binary file 
   called binary_string_file.dat

4. create a program to read the binary string and print it to stdout
   from binary_string_file.dat

5. create a program that has a struct called student_record
   it will contain 
   1.string to hold the name
   2.int to hold the student record
   3.int to hold what number is this record

   write the details to a binary file called student_records.dat

6. create a file to read the binary file from above and print it out

7. using the above , modify it so that a number of structs are written to the file
   once the structs have been written , ask the user for which record to 
   search for e.g the third struct 
   using fseek get the record and print it out

8. using the above , modify it so that the list is printed out once 
   then using fseek , reset it to the start and print it out again
