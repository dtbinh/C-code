1. create a program that contains 
   a function that will take 2 variables 
   they will be of type int
   and return the added value

2. modify the above program so that it will
   show the summation of numbers upto the 20th summation 
   starting from zero

3. modify the above again to have it deal with 
   integers and doubles in the arguements , every second number will be a double

4. modify the above so that the first arguement is a string that 
   will tell the function whether to add , subtract , multiply or divide the numbers
   for simplicity have it only take floats

5. make a program that will take multiple
   characters and print them out one by one
   
6. modify the above program so that it will take multiple
   strings and print them out one by one

7. Using the variable arguements listing 
   create your own function that
   will print out integer arrays 

8. create your own version of printf that will work with
   1.characters,
   2.strings,
   3.floats(floats are upgraded to double through
   the varaible list functions), also you canuse fprintf only for floats
   4.integer of what was entered
   5.octal of what was entered
   6.hexadecimal of what was entered
   7.binary form of what was entered

	for simplicity only numbers will be converted
	not characters or strings
        and arguements will only be printed in the 
        order they were entered
	
	But if you feel like it , do them all
