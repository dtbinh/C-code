1. Create a enumeration that will contain 
   4 directional varaibles 
   e.g 
       int north 
       int south 
       int east 
       int west

  Taking user input , print which one the user picks
  by comparing the numbers the user enters

2. create a enum with these int members
	
	a,
	b,
	c,
	d = 6,
	e,
	f,
	g = 20,
	h

3. using the above enum , print out the members
   of it 
   What did you find was printed out ?
   Why did this occur ?

4. create a union that contains two variables
   an integer "a" and a double "b"
   
   it will also have a variable called "var"

5. using the above make a program that will 
   assign the numbers a = 2 
   and b = 8.9876
   print out both numbers
   now repeat this except reverse the order of the 
   assignment i.e b=8.9876 and a =2
 
   what happens and why ?


6. create an an enum with the members Monday,Tuesday, Wensday ...
   not taking input get the current day and have the program 
   print the special pizza of the day

   Example:
       if its monday then its Meat Supreme
       if its tuesday then its Vegetarian supreme
       if its thursday then its bacon and beef
       and so on

7.  create a structure called complex_d
    complex_d will contain 2 variables called real and imaginary of 
    type double


8.  create a union of these types
	A.char
	B.int
	C.float
	D.double

  call the union data
  create a program that will take input and print out the 
  input for each data type 

9. using the above create an array of unions that will allow you to
    take input and print all the data types out
