1. create a struct called shop_parts
   that will contain the following pieces

   A.int id number
   B.a character string for the part name
   C. struct pointer to shop_parts called *next

2. modify the above by using a typedef structure
   instead of a regular structure

3. using the above self referencing struct 
   place something into the head of the list

   N.B
   make sure to set the tail to NULL
   and also to deallocate the memory at the end of the program

4. modify the above so that head will be switched with the 
   tail and the list be run backwards

5. using the same self referential structure 
   create a program that can have N number of parts added

6. modify the above so that the program can remove certain parts of the list

7. modify the above program so that it will sort the list into one of two
   ways the user can ask for 

   A.ID number
   B.Alphabetical

8. using the same structure , modify it so that it will contain 
   2 pointers , one called previous and one called next , the previous 
   pointer will point to the previous structure while next will point 
   to the next structure

   Have the program be able to print the list either way one by one 
   i.e the user is at node 2 , they choose to go forward by one 
   the next node (node 3) is printed
   the user then chooses to go the last node 
   the last node (node 2) is printed
