These header files needed for most of these questions

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<errno.h>
#include<signal.h>
#include<assert.h>

1. Create a program that will deal with dividing a number by another number ,
   it must be able to deal with zero being a divisor

2. Create a program that will deal with getting the square root of a number 
   you can use the sqrt() function in math.h , but the prorgam must be
   able to deal with the error and print that the error has occured using the 
   error code from errno as the condition

3. modify the above 
   print out the error code and the error name using the strerror in a printing function
   when the error occurs 

4. Modify the above 
   Using perror to print to the stderr stream the error code and error name

5. Using the assert() function from assert.h file 
   have it abort the program if the number to user enters isnt the 
   correct one

6. modify the above so that it will use raise(); from the signal.h file
   to terminate the program if a condition is true

7. Create a program that will use raise to signal an arithmetic error due to either 
   overflow or  division by zero 

8. modify the above so that the program will exit using exit(); only it signals 
   that the program failed to the OS
