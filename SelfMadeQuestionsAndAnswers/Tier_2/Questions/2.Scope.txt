1. These are the three main file scope types

   Global
   automatic/register
   static
   
   what are the main differences in the storage handling ?

2. Create a file that contains this piece

	for( x=0; x<10; x++)
	{
 	 	for( y=0; y<10; y++)
 	 	{
 	 		  static int number_of_times = 0;
 	 		  number_of_times++;
 	 	}
	}
	
   What happens and Why?

3. Write a file that contains function
   declarations for file scope

4. create a header file that will hold the 
   declarations of functions in it
   add the file to your .c program file and use the function declarations
   in that other file

5. is the following code legal or not ? and if it is legal or not 
   what is the value of j?

	int i=1;

	void f(void)
	{
		int j=i;
		int i=2;
	}


6. create a file that will hold a global variable 
   called count 
   create a function within this file
   that will also have a variable 
   of the same type as count and use it
   to count to 100
   
   print the number countained in both counts in and out 
   of the function
   Which count is used in file scope and block scope
   and why does this occur ?

7. look at these functions and declarations 
    what is the scope of the all the variables

int ch;

int main()
{
...
...
return 0;
}

int count;

int fun1()
{

	extern int number;
	return 0;
}

int fun2()
{
	extern int ch;
	return 0; 
}

int fun3()
{
	
	return 0;
}


8. These functions are suppose to print a line of *'s
   then the other prints 10 lines 
  look at the following functions , what is the problem with the 
  the declarations ?

 int i;
 void print_line(void)
 {
	for(i=1;i<=10;i++)
	{
		printf("*");
	}
 }

 void print_all_rows(void)
 {
	for(i=1;i<=10;i++)
	{
		print_line();
		printf("\n");
	}
 }


9. Please observe the following functions and declarations below
 
	int a;
	
	void f(int b)
	{
		int c;
	}

	void g(void)
	{
		int d;
		{
			int e;
		}
	}

	int main(void)
	{
		int f;
		return 0;
	}

	for each of the following scopes , list all variable and parameter visible in that scope
  	(I).the f function
	(II). the g function
	(III).the block in which e is declared
	(IV).the main function

10. Please observe the following functions and declarations below
 
	int b,c;
	
	void f(void)
	{
		int b,d;
	}

	void g(int a)
	{
		int c;
		{
			int a,d;
		}
	}

	int main(void)
	{
		int c,d;
		return 0;
	}

	for each of the following scopes , list all variable and parameter visible in that scope
  	(I).the f function
	(II). the g function
	(III).the block in which e is declared
	(IV).the main function
