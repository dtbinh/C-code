1. write a program that has a pointer to an int
   print out the value of that int using the pointer

2. write a program that has a pointer to an int
   have the pointer be passed to another function 
   change the value , print out the value of the 
   memory location and the value inside the memory location
   before and after changing it

3. write a program that has a pointer to a character
   have the user pass it through a function and print it
   in that function

4. like above , write a program that has a array of 
   pointers of type char have the user enter a word 
   and display that word using the pointer array in
   another function

5. Using the above , modify the string in the memory locations
   so that it will be printed backward and not just printed backward

6. write a program that will swap pointers that won't swap the 
   memory locations but simply whats held in them
	eg. 
		Swap(int *a,int *b){}
	Example:

		user enters 1,2

		console returns 2,1 

7. create a number search function that will scan through an array
   and show where it shows in memory

8. create a letter search function that will scan a pointer to a string
   for a letter and show the memory location it is held in

9. create a program that will sort the contents of an array
    of numbers using any sort method E.G bubble sort

10. create a string swap function that will operate using pointers
    to strings
