1. using the macros , create two macros for the 
   block statement brackets(curly braces)
   and create a program using it 
	Example :

	#include<stdio.h>
	#define start {
	#define end }

	int main()
	start
	
	printf("Hello World\r\n");
	
	return 0;
	end
	 
	example cannot be used

2. Create a macro that will mimic the printf function
   call it print

3. modify the above so that the print will print something 
   the user inputs

4. create your own macro using the stdio macro , print the name of the function that called this macro 
   .The program will print this at execution time

5. create your own macro using the stdio macro, print the name of the file that is being executed
   , this printing will occur during execution time

6. create your own macro using the stdio macro , create a program that will give you the 
   date and time that the program was compiled at

7. create your own macro using the stdio macro , create a program that will tell you whether the 
   current compilation follows the ANSI C standard

8. Using what you've learned from programs 4-7 , create a program that will take all of these macros and print them to 
   a file called compilation_log.txt

9. using the macros create a program 
   that looks like pseudo-code 
   To illustrate , create a program that will 
   printout 10 of the mersenne primes

10. using the above , place all macros in a header file called
    my_macro.h
    Create a program that will use the header file and run the 
    mersenne program from there
	to include your own header file
	simple use #include "my_macro.h"
	and make sure it is in the same directory
